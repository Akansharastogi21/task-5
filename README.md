# Titanic — Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 5 DA)

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Titanic dataset (Kaggle-style `train.csv`). The analysis inspects data quality, visualizes univariate/bivariate relationships, performs simple feature engineering, and produces a short findings report.

The filled findings PDF and the notebook outputs were generated from the provided notebook export. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Files in this repo
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with the full EDA pipeline (data loading, cleaning suggestions, visualizations, feature engineering, and plot saving). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- `Titanic_report_of_finding.pdf` — 2-page filled report summarizing the key findings and containing selected visuals extracted from the notebook. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- `plots_report.pdf` (optional) — combined PNGs of the saved figures (created by the notebook if you run the image-combine cell).  
- `survival_summary_by_pclass_sex.csv` (example output) — summary table generated by the notebook showing survival counts and rates by `Pclass` and `Sex`.

> Note: If `train.csv` is not included in this repository (to avoid data licensing issues), download it from Kaggle and place it in the same folder as the notebook before running.

## Key findings (short)
These values were computed from the notebook outputs and appear in the filled report:
- Dataset size: **891 rows**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Missing values: `Age` — **714 non-null** (177 missing); `Cabin` — **204 non-null** (687 missing); `Embarked` — **889 non-null** (2 missing).   
- Overall survival rate: **38.38%** (~342 survivors / 891).   
- Notable subgroup survival rates (from grouped summary):  
  - 1st class, female — **96.81%** (n=94).   
  - 2nd class, female — **92.11%** (n=76).   
  - 3rd class, female — **50.00%** (n=144).   
  - 1st class, male — **36.89%** (n=122).   
  - 3rd class, male — **13.54%** (n=347). 

(Full visuals and the code that produced these numbers are available in `Titanic_EDA.ipynb`.) :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
